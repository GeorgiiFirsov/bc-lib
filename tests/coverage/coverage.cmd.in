:: Run OpenCppCoverage app with the following parameters:
:: - modules to inspect: bc-lib-test.exe (bc-lib is a static library, 
::                       hence here I must inspect a test executable)
:: - sources to inspect: everything located in current project, except 
::                       tests source itself (it isn't a functionality to cover)
:: - excluded lines: else and closing brackets (well, that's how OpenCppCoverage works)
:: - module to run: bc-lib-test.exe (executable with Google Tests)
